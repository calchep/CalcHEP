1 How to unpack the codes
</H2> 
The name of the  received file which you have copied  from the CalcHEP WWW 
page   should be 
<P>
<TT>calchep_2.4.#.tgz </TT>
<BR> where # - denotes the number of release
<P>
Unpack this file by 

<P>
<TT>tar -xzf calchep_2.4.#.tgz </TT>
<BR>
or
<BR> 
<TT> mv calchep_2.4.#.tgz calchep_2.4.#.tar.gz 
<BR>gunzip calchep_2.4.#.tar.gz
<BR> tar -xvf calchep_2.3.#.tar
</TT> 
<P>
As a result a directory  'calchep_2.4.#'  should be created.This directory contains  source codes  of the
CalcHEP package for UNIX platforms. 
  
<H2><A NAME="SECTION000220"></A>  
             <A NAME="compilation"></A>
<BR>
2 Compilation procedure
</H2>          In order to compile the CalcHEP  source code you need a <I>C</I>&nbsp; compiler
with the X11 graphics library.  The compilation  is launched by the

<P>
<TT>gmake</TT>  or <TT>make</TT>
<P>
command started from the CalcHEP root directory. Indeed <TT>gmake</TT> options are 
needed. But if <TT>gmake</TT> is absence, it as rule means that your 
<TT>make</TT> works like <TT>gmake</TT>.

<P>
If the  <I>C</I>  compiler and X11 files  are detected and the  sources 
are compiled successfully  you will see the message:
<P>
<TT>"CalcHEP can be started."
</TT>
<P>
Otherwise  the corresponding error message comes out.
See 
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="install.html#SECTION000240"> below </A>
 a discussion of possible problems.

<P>
The files in the CalcHEP root directory will be
used only for reading and execution during the user session. 
It provides one with a possibility to have one CalcHEP root
directory for several users. 

<P>
Each user has to create his own directory to work with CalcHEP. 
See an instruction for the user installation  in the next section.


<H2><A NAME="SECTION000230"></A>     
             <A NAME="u-install"></A>
<BR>

 3 User installation and start of the CalcHEP session
</H2>          
<P>
The CalcHEP root directory is not intended to start  a session.
For this  purpose  the user has to prepare a special  working directory. 
A few working directories may be created for  various tasks and by different
users. 

<P>
The user working directory is prepared by the command <BR>
<TT> ./mkWORKdir </TT><I>  dir_Name </I> <BR>
launched from the CalcHEP root directory. For example <BR>
<TT> ./mkWORKdir ~/WORK </TT> <BR>

As a result  the  following sub-directories and files
should appear in your <I>WORK</I> directory:
<BR>  <TT>models/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   tmp/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  results/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bin/</TT>
<BR>  <TT>calchep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   calchep.ini   </TT>

<P>
The directory   <I>models</I> is used for  files which describe models 
of particle interactions. The directory  <I>tmp</I> is created for temporal
files.  The directory <I>results</I> is  assigned for a CalcHEP&nbsp; output.
<I>bin</I> is a symbolic link to CalcHEP executables.
<P>
To start a CalcHEP&nbsp; session  you should issue a command
<BR> <TT>./calchep</TT>

<P>
The <I>calchep.ini</I> file allows  to choose an 
appropriate text font for the CalcHEP&nbsp; window, select the  color or colorless
mode for the window and also switch on/off the sound signal. The syntax of  
this file is self-explanatory.


<H2><A NAME="SECTION000240">
Possible problems </A>
</H2> 

<P>
At first step  <I>make_all</I>  lauches <I>getflags</I>. 
The target of this program is generation of  files 
 <I>FlagsForSh</I> and <I>FlagsForMake</I>  which contains names 
of C and Fortran compilers and  compiler flags.   
 If <I>FlagsForSh</I> is absent, it is generated autmatically depending 
on Unix platform.  Otherwise  <I>getflags</I>  checks the flags 
written in  <I>FlagsForSh</I>. Thus in case of problem user has 
to correct <I>FlagsForSh</I> and start  <I>make_all</I>  or
<I>getflags</I> again.   <I>FlagsForMake</I> contains the same 
flags but for usage in Makefiles. It is corrected automatically. 
<P>
To use CalcHEP in graphic interface mode one should have installed <br>
<TT>   libX11-devel </TT>  for Fedora/Scientific, Darwin(MAC) <br>
<TT>    libX11-dev  </TT>   for Ubuntu/Debian <br>
<TT>   xorg-x11-devel </TT> for SUSE  <br>
If the package is installed, one should see X11 header files in directory <TT>/usr/include/X11</TT> <br>


<H2><A NAME="SECTION000250">
Model installation </A>
</H2>
                                                                                
<P>
 CalcHEP contains only SM. Other models should be installed 
indepedently.
To install new model the user has to
<BR>
a) download the corresponding <TT>  MODEL.tgz</TT> file.
<BR>
b) unpack it; In result directory <TT>MODEL</TT> with CalcHEP model files and
   codes for external functions will be generated.
<BR>
c) If you don't dispose  <TT>MODEL</TT> in CalcHEP directory, improve
   definition of CALCHEP variable in <TT>MODEL/Makefile</TT>. It has to
   show the path to CalcHEP directory  which is used to dowload the file
   with compiler flags.
<BR>
d) read README file attached to the model and make the corresponding changes
   in Makefile if it needs.
<BR>
e) launch  'gmake' inside <TT>MODEL</TT>. If 'gmake' is absent try 'make'.
   The Makefile is written for 'gmake', but in modern platforms sometimes
   'make' presents the 'gmake' command.  In results of compilation you
    should get the mLib.a library.
<BR>
f) To add a new model to the list of models for your working sessions use
the
   "IMPORT OF MODELS" menu function. It asks you to define the directory
    where model is disposed:
<BR>
      <TT>  Dir= 'path to MODEL'/models </TT>
<BR>
    For expample, in case of MSSM disposed directly inside CalcHEP
<BR>
      <TT>    Dir= $CALCHEP/MSSM/models </TT>
