Main facilities.
</H1>       
<P>
CalcHEP&nbsp; is a package for automatic calculations of elementary particle
decay and collision properties in the lowest order of perturbation theory
(the tree approximation).  The main idea prescribed into the CalcHEP&nbsp; is to
make available passing on from the Lagrangian to the final distributions
effectively with a high level of automation.  
Other packages  created to solve  a similar problem
are  
<I>FeynArts/FeynCalc</I>[<A
 HREF="node4.html#FeynArt">1</A>], <I>GRACE</I>[<A
 HREF="node4.html#GRACE">2</A>], <I>HELAS</I>[<A
 HREF="node4.html#HELAS">3</A>], 
<I>MADGRAPH</I>[<A
 HREF="node4.html#MADGRAPH">4</A>]. See also the review [<A
 HREF="node4.html#Harlander">5</A>].

<P>
CalcHEP&nbsp; is a menu-driven system with the context help. The notations
used in CalcHEP&nbsp; are very similar to those used in particle physics. 

<P>
The present version contains the
 Standard Model (SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1))  and its Minimal Sypersymmetry 
extension (MSSM). 
 The user can change particle interaction and model
parameters. It is also possible to create new  models of particle
interaction.

<P>
In the present version polarizations are not taken into account.
Averaging over initial and summing over final polarizations are performed
automatically. 

<P>
The CalcHEP&nbsp; package consists of two parts: symbolic and numerical ones. 
The symbolic part  generats 
  codes for a squared matrix
element which   are used in the numerical calculations.

<P>
The symbolic part of CalcHEP&nbsp; lets the user:

<P>
<UL>
<LI> select a model of particle interaction and implement some
changes in the model. In paricular one can choose the package for
solution of RGE equations in case of SUGRA models;

</LI><P><LI>

   coose a gauge. Physical gauge and t'Hooft-Feynman one are available.
</LI><P><LI>
select a process by specifying incoming and outgoing particles for
the decays of 1->2, ..., 1->5   types and the collisions of
2->2, ..., 2->4  types;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>generate  Feynman diagrams,  display them, and create the
corresponding L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X&nbsp; output;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>exclude some diagrams;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>generate and display squared Feynman diagrams;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>calculate analytical expressions corresponding to squared diagrams
   by using the fast built-in symbolic calculator;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>save symbolic results corresponding to the squared diagrams
   calculated in the <I>Reduce</I>&nbsp; and <I>Mathematica</I>&nbsp;
codes for  further
   symbolic manipulations;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>generate the optimized <I>C</I>&nbsp;  codes for the squared matrix
   elements for further numerical calculations;

<P>
</LI>
<LI> launch the compilation of the generated codes and start the
corresponding numerical session;

<P></LI><LI>  generates libraries of matrix elements for other 
packages.

</UL>

<P>
The numerical part of CalcHEP&nbsp; offers to:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>convolute  the squared matrix element  with structure functions and
beam spectra. <I>CTEQ</I>&nbsp; PDFLIB, CTEQ, MRST  parton
   distribution functions, the  ISR and  Beamstrahlung spectra of electrons,
   the laser photon spectrum,
   and the Weizsaecker-Williams photon structure functions are
   available;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>modify physical parameters ( incoming momenta, couplings, 
masses etc.)
   involved in the process;
                                                                           
<P>
</LI>
<LI>select the scale parameter for evaluation of the QCD coupling constant and
   parton structure functions;

</LI>
<LI> calculate Higgses widths and decay rates taking into account
hight order QCD loop corrections.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>apply various kinematic cuts.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>define the kinematic scheme (phase space parameterization) for
   effective Monte Carlo integration;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>introduce a phase space mapping in order to 
smooth sharp peaks of a squared matrix element and structure functions;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>perform  a   Monte Carlo phase space  integration by <I>Vegas</I>;


<P>
</LI>
<LI>generate partonic level events and direct them to <I>PYTHIA</I>; 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>display distributions in various kinematic variables;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>create the graphical and L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X&nbsp; outputs for histograms.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The current version is accompanied  with different {\it batch}
programs which allows to performs all calculations in non-interactive
regime.
