AB would like to thank the NExT Institute and SEPnet for partial
financial support.  The work of  AB and AP was strongly supported
by  the Royal Society grants JP090598 and JP090146.

AP was also supported in part by 12-02-93108-CNRSLa   RFBR grant  and LIA-TCAP CNRS grant.


The work of NC was supported in part by the
US National Science Foundation under grant PHY-0354226, the LHC-TI
initiative of the US National Science Foundation under grant
PHY-0705682, the PITTsburgh Particle physics, Astrophysics, and
Cosmology Center, and the US Department of Energy under grant DE-
FG02-12ER41832.
<P>
A large part of the recent developments in CalcHEP was motivated by requests for the micrOMEGAs
package which uses CalcHEP as a generator of matrix elements. We thank
Genevieve Belanger and  Fawzi Boudjema  for helpful comments and suggestions in the development of
CalcHEP.
<P>
CalcHEP is also known for its succesful usage of various SM extensions  mainly due to the
pioneering work of Andrey Semenov in the development of the LanHEP package
which allows to  realize rather complicated models in CalcHEP~notation.
We are grateful to  Andrey Semenov for this job.
<P>
NC would like to thank Fabio Maltoni and Claude Duhr for their support
in writing a CalcHEP output for the FeynRules package.
<P>
Much of the batch interface was developed and tested at the Michigan State University High Performance Computer Center.
<P>
In 2009 AB and   AP  worked
together at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics where
part of the CalcHEP development  was performed. We are grateful to GGI for  this opportunity and support.
<P>
We are especially thankful to Maksym Bondarenko, the main author of the HEPMDB project
which has turned out to be very important for various web applications of \CalcHEP.
<P>
We are grateful to many people who have tested CalcHEP, especially to Lorenzo Basso, Alexandra Carvalho, Joydeep Chakrabortty, Qing-Hong Cao, Mikhail Chizhov, Asesh Datta, Mads Frandsen, Renato Guedes, K.C.  Kong, Tomas Lastovicka, Orlando Panella, Rui Santos, Chloe Papineau,  Marco Pruna, Patrik Svantesson, Florian Staub,  Daniel Stolarski, Riccardo Torre,  Izmail Turan and Alfonso Zerwekh.

<P>
